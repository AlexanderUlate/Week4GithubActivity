There once was a really long dragon that went through the skies at the speed of sound.
Without much of a warning, he would go down to the local markets and feast on apples.
One day, a brave challenger was attempting to take a piece of the dragon's scale while he was eating an apple.
The challenger was burnt to a crisp and his ashes were taken to the city's central river.
As the ashes were carried on horseback, a local blacksmith's daughter peered out the window of their homestead to witness the caravan.
Feeling sorrow for the warrior's death and anger at the dragon's constant rampages, she headed to the village square to become a knight.
Finding no one willing to teach her, she returned home to ask her father to help her train to take on the dragon. While he was hesitant,
he saw the flame of determination in her eyes. He knew there would be no stopping her, so he trained her in the craft of blacksmithing
while her mother oversaw her dexterity and fighting training. As she hammered out the last of her armor, her mother handed her a sword
that was made by their ancestors out of a metalic meteorite found near their home. With her mother's sword in hand, she set off on her quest.
