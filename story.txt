There once was a really long dragon that went through the skies at the speed of sound.
Without much of a warning, he would go down to the local markets and feast on apples.
One day, a brave challenger was attempting to take a piece of the dragon's scale while he was eating an apple.
The challenger was burnt to a crisp and his ashes were taken to the city's central river.
